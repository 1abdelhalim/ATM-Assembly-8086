## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic ATM system developed in Assembly language (8086). It's a simulation of an ATM with essential functionalities implemented using 8086 assembly instructions.

## Features

- **Withdrawal:** Allows users to withdraw a specified amount from their account.
- **Deposit:** Facilitates depositing funds into the account.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Provides the ability to check the account balance.

## Usage

To utilize this ATM system implemented in Assembly language (8086), follow these steps:

1. **Download an 8086 Emulator:**
   - Obtain an appropriate 8086 emulator. [https://emu8086.en.lo4d.com/windows], for example.
   - Ensure the emulator is compatible with your system's specifications.

2. **Download the Code:**
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/1abdelhalim/ATM-Assembly-8086.git
     ```
   - If you prefer, you can also download the repository as a ZIP archive using [this link](https://github.com/1abdelhalim/ATM-Assembly-8086/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).


3. **Run the Emulator:**
   - Open the downloaded 8086 emulator.
   - Load or open the assembly code file (`*.asm`) within the emulator's environment.
   - Assemble and run the code within the emulator. Follow the emulator's specific instructions for loading and executing assembly programs.

4. **Interacting with the ATM System:**
   - Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts or input instructions provided by the ATM system.
   - Use the functionalities provided, such as withdrawal, deposit, and balance inquiry.
   - Input test scenarios or follow the predefined steps outlined in the code to simulate ATM operations.

5. **Exiting the Emulator:**
   - Follow the emulator's instructions to exit or close the program.

6. **Testing and Experimentation:**
   - Feel free to experiment with the code, modify inputs, or explore the assembly implementation to understand how the ATM system functions.
   - Test different scenarios to observe the system's behavior and responses.
